# Summary

Packages a DataJoint solution to a Spatio-Temporal Receptive Field (STRF) using Spike-Triggered Average (STA) from provided experimental data involving retinal ganglion cells.

Provides support for:

  - Pipeline Design
  - STA Computation
  - Computation Visualization


# Instructions

TBD


# Points for Improvement

- Identify Neuron import files by primary keys associated with table.
- Utilize file directories as parameters in dj.Lookup. Is this valid for Import tables?


# Assumptions

- Element1
- Element2
